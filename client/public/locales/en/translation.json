Each lodging has its private space, with no overlooking, on a large shared property ideal for relaxation and shared moments.\n            <br />\n            Ideally located, they offer privileged access to numerous mountain activities: hikes for all levels, Guzet-Neige ski resort, Aulus-les-Bains thermal baths, tree climbing courses, canoeing, climbing, horseback riding, or cycling... Nature lovers will enjoy the richness of the surroundings, where the seasons unfold with chestnuts, mushrooms, and wild blueberries.\n            <br />\n            Just steps from the lodgings, the Garbet River will appeal to trout fishermen; by prior reservation, the owner, a state-certified fishing guide instructor, offers introductions or improvements to recreational fishing (service independent of the rental).\n            <br />\n            The region is also known for its authentic markets, notably Saint-Girons, full of colors and flavors.\n            <br />5 km away, you will find all essential shops and services: post office, grocery store, butcher, bakery-pastry shop, newsstand, restaurants, doctor, and pharmacy.\n            <br />\n            Animals are accepted with prior agreement from the owners, so that everyone can fully enjoy the peace and charm of this preserved corner of Ariège.",
